          >he desire to be respected by someone of the opposite sex is something
          that runs deep within everyone, even though most people don't take the
          time find someone who truly respects them.IT seems like people are
          just looking for someone to show them the slightest amount of
          attetion, settling for something much less then respect.I am convinced
          one of the best ways to help any relationship grow is by showing
          respect.

          I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to be respected.
          What is respect? Respect is showing someone extra special attention,
          or high regarad. based on a desire to show them how highly they are
          valued.
